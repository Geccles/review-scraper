Not to mention she's great at what she does. She coordinated everything we needed before visiting Boston in order to buy a place and move. She even picked us up at the airport so we could immediately go look at the string of places that we were interested in. We found a great place that we were happy with. Even after everything was said and done, she checked in with us to make sure we were still happy, or if we needed services for moving to our new home. She's thoughtful and thorough with her work. She is a pleasure to work with and made looking for a place to live in a completely new place EASY. We highly recommend her specifically, but also believe in the company she works for, Compass. What a user friendly website/app! It made everything smooth and easy to evaluate the places we were looking at. We could easily sort by price, location, and qualifications we were looking for in a place. We loved that Clair had access to our collections so that she could see our comments, talk to us, know what we were looking for, and she could recommend new places. It made our search easy to look at places that our realtor already scouted out for us. Overall, 5 stars for Clair, Compass and our overall experience.",5,False,SMRAC,An easy choice,
1,2018-06-25 19:10:43,"We recently started using Compass through our new agent. It‚Äôs a really great way to share properties including notes about each one and overall have everything at your fingertips when  using an agent during your housing search or just browsing. Luckily for us our agent has kept us up to date every step of the way - even at 10pm some nights! - and this app has been an indispensable tool for how we‚Äôre able to communicate with everyone involved in the search. However the app isn‚Äôt perfect. I‚Äôve experienced multiple crashes while using it, but what would be incredibly useful is when you receive an update or message about a property a feature on the Workshop or Collections page that links you directly with the notification itself. The only way you‚Äôre able to view the message is by clicking the push notification or link via email and, once in the app, then scrolling to that particular property and looking for the yellow dot that indicates a message is waiting. If you‚Äôre like me and have more than 10+ properties that you‚Äôre eyeing this becomes pretty cumbersome. Also, it‚Äôd be nice to edit the order of the saved properties in your Collections however you‚Äôd like, either by ultimate favorites, notification waiting, last viewed, etc.. I‚Äôm hoping there will be an update with the Compass app soon but in the meantime it‚Äôs been very useful despite the roundabout way to view and read your notifications.",4,False,GreenEggsNTam,"Great way to communicate with your agent, but..",
2,2020-08-28 20:36:57,"Huge fan of Compass and everything that they‚Äôre doing. A lot like Redfin or Zillow, but better looking features in the app and with better people involved in the company from what I can tell. Been very impressed by Robert Reffkin anytime he‚Äôs on CNBC. Smart guy. In our market here in Chicago, Compass seems to have taken over the market out of nowhere. My wife looks at real estate everyday, and is always on Compass searching for places. The Coming Soon places are cool - only available on their site and their app I guess. Haven‚Äôt tried the private exclusives yet - I believe if you work with one of their agents you can see hidden properties that no one else can see? Also had a friend do Compass Concierge to fix their place up for free before they sold. They got more money on their place and did really well. Really happy with it from what they said. A few bugs I‚Äôve noticed in the app, but not bad. Last update fixed a lot. Way better than Zillow, and I like better than Redfin too.

3,2019-05-24 19:35:09,"Have been using this app recently as I‚Äôm planning a move to a different city, where Compass has a presence. At first, the search functionality felt a bit limited, especially when compared to more established apps like Zillow. However, I quickly noticed that updates were being launched consistently and has made the overall user interface of the app much easier to use and navigate. The listings on Compass are plentiful, with some of them being exclusive to Compass before it shows up on other apps and websites.

4,2018-09-19 18:42:05,"Been using for 4 months. Nice interface, good potential, not there yet. Often frustrating.

Notifications don‚Äôt work properly like other apps. When notification for a new property displays, when you click on it it only takes you to the app and does not take to to the relevant page for the property, which means then you have to scroll through all of your searches to see where the new listing is (and this can often be laggy, so the new listing may not even show up right away when you scroll to it.

This is especially important when your agent writes to you about a specific property and you click on the notification to read the message. Doesn‚Äôt take you to the page.

Once you click on a notification, it disappears from your notifications, unlike every other app. So when you can‚Äôt find where the notification was supposed to take you and you go back to read which listing it pertained to, it‚Äôs gone.

Sometimes when you add listing to your collections,. They don‚Äôt update. 

Yesterday when I added comments to a property for my agent to read, they did not appear in the app, but an email message was sent saying there was a new comment.

Many bugs. Keep improving please.",3,False,btstudio,Ok but lots of issues,"{'id': 10655032, 'body': 'We‚Äôve made updates to ensure your notifications make sense, are on time, and pop up where they‚Äôre supposed to. Happy searching!', 'modified': '2019-09-12T17:13:40Z'}"
5,2019-11-10 03:46:44,"I only downloaded the app because I couldn‚Äôt view the collection that my agent shared with me. The website was just blank on that page. Luckily, I was able to view the collection through the app. That‚Äôs basically all I can do. 

The search page is awful. You can enter a full address and it won‚Äôt even show you a map of where the address is. Search only works if you enter a listing that is listed, because of this, you can‚Äôt even search the neighborhood for available listings. 

This next one is probably the most annoying issue with the app. You cannot use map view I‚Äôm collections. You can only see the list view. If you try to use the map, it hovers above New Brunswick. If you move the map to the correct city, your saved listings are not on the map. 

Note: if you mark a listing as ‚Äúnot until interested‚Äù, you can‚Äôt add it back to your collection. You can find it and it‚Äôs still marked as saved. If you un-save and re-save, it still doesn‚Äôt populate in your collection.

The photo slider is funky, it does slide smoothly from photo to photo, often requiring multiple swipes to move from one photo to another. Another irritating feature of this app is that you often have to tap ‚Äúcomments‚Äù rather than the main tile to expand and view a property. Why can‚Äôt I just tap the big tile? Why make me take an extra step to get where I want to be?

Even though we went with another service, I was a huge fan of the whole experience and had recommended it to several friends. Unfortunately their poor data security has made me wary of even using the app again.

Here‚Äôs what happened:
About a year after our first engagement with Compass, I was using the app to casually browse properties for sale in my area. A few days after my search, I received an unsolicited email from the realtor we hadn‚Äôt spoken to in over a year a year prior asking about the homes I was looking at on the app. 

That means over a year after our contract ended (without any ongoing relationship), the realtor was still able to track my behavior on the app without my knowledge or consent. 

I confirmed with a previous compass employee that compass does not practice adequate data and security practices for their clients - so it stands to reason that if this realtor can see our personally identifying information beyond the duration of our contact and monitor our app usage, who else at the company has access to that information? What about external vendors? 

I emailed support immediately but the email was ignored.
